title: "Open source Photosynth: PixelStruct 0.2 released"
---

PixelStruct 0.2 has been released. This version has two main changes from the previous version. Firstly, several new transition modes are available, allowing near seamless transition between photos. Secondly, various bugs have been fixed, allowing larger image sets to be viewed, such as the following 715-image reconstruction of Notre Dame.
