title: LaTeX Glassware
---

A set of macros for drawing diagrams of laboratory glassware and other scientific equipment in LaTeX.

Requires [PGF/TikZ][2]. I've only tested it with PDFLaTeX, so it may or may not work with other TeX flavours. See [this][3] document ([source][4]) for an example of usage.
