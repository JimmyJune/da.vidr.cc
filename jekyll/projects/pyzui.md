PyZUI is an implementation of a Zooming User Interface (ZUI) for Python.

It uses the [PyQt][1] toolkit, and runs on both Linux and Windows (although obviously Linux is the recommended platform :) ).

The following screencast outlines some of its features (please refer to the [Manual][2] for other features not included). Information about some of the media demonstrated can be found [here][3].
