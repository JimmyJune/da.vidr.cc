---

PyTextCat guesses the language of a given input text from over 70 different languages.

It is an implementation of the classification technique described by William B.
Cavnar & John M. Trenkle (1994) in [N-Gram-Based Text Categorization][1], and is
based upon Gertjan van Noord's [Perl implementation][2].

Both a Python library and a command-line interface are provided.

PyTextCat is released under GPLv2 (see COPYING). The lm files and test texts
are from [TextCat][2], and are therefore licensed under LGPLv2.1
(see COPYING.LGPL). Source code is available for [download at GitHub][3].
