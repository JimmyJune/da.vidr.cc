rtNEATbox is a simple neuro-evolution sandbox.

Two-dimensional levels can be
created, in which a group of organisms are simulated. The goal is for the
organisms to navigate the terrain to reach a certain goal point. [rtNEAT][2] is
used for the neuro-evolution of the organisms. Physics simulation is provided
by [Box2D][3].
